# 04_CodeQuiz

## Description

I made this webpage so people can play a game, test their knowledge of js, and html and share/save the results locally. I made it using JavaScript to update the content of the page and have a timer and save the values for the timer and the inputed name so that they can be posted of the highscore page.
